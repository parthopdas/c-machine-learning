#### Notes: 
- Regression vs Classification: 

|| Regression | Classification |
| - | - | - |
| Predicted values | Continuos | Discrete | 
| Intuition | Predictions are points on a hyper-plane. | Predictions are points in hyper-volumes divided by a hyper-plane | 
| Linear vs Polynomial | Hyper-plane vs Hyper-surface | Hyper-volumes on 'either side' of Hyper-plane vs Hyper-surface | 
| E.g. for $n = 1$, output is | Straight line in $\mathbb{R}^2$ | Areas on either side of a straight line in $\mathbb{R}^2$  |
| Linear vs Polynomial | Hyper-plane vs Curved Hyper-surface in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ | Hyper-volumes on 'either side' of Hyper-plane vs Curved Hyper-surface in in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ |
